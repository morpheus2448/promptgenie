# üßû PromptGenie - A useful, always available CLI assistant

## Overview

PromptGenie is a Command Line Interface (CLI) assistant designed to provide quick responses to a wide range of queries. It utilizes llama.cpp and a quantized language model to generate responses. The assistant can be invoked with the command pg followed by a prompt, like pg are pisachios healthy? or pg how to show free space in GB?. It consumes minimal system resources and can handle various types of queries. The current configuration only uses the CPU, but you can easily edit the pg.sh file and use some GPU layers!

## Prerequisites

- GNU/Linux - Windows compatibility may come soon.
- The `main` binary from (llama.cpp)[https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp].
- GGML format language model (tested with (rosa_v2_7b.Q4_0.gguf)[https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Rosa_v2_7B-GGUF/resolve/main/rosa_v2_7b.Q4_0.gguf])).
